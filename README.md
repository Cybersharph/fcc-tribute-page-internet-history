# Tribute Page

This project is part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** offered by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It is a tribute page that showcases an individual by presenting an image, a bio, and a timeline of their life events, all styled responsively.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The page layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Custom Bullet Styles**: The timeline uses checkmarks as custom bullet points to make the list visually appealing.
- **Image Styling**: The image is responsive, with rounded corners and a subtle shadow effect to enhance its appearance.
- **Clean and Modern Design**: The page uses simple, elegant design principles with attention to readability and usability.
